####Chapter 2 Operators and Statements.
#####Numeric Promotion Rules
1. If two values have different data types, Java will automatically promote one os the values to the larger of the two data types
2. If one of the values is integral and the other is floating-point, Java will automatically promote the integral value to the floating-point value's data type.
3. Smaller data types, namely byte, short and chart are first promoted to int any time they're used with a Java binary arithmetic operator, even if neither of the operands is int.
4. After all promotion has ocurred and the operands have the same data type the resulting value will have the same fata type as its promoted operands.
